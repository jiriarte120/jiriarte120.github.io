				<p>El VegetaBull’s story began whe we met a beautiful baby bull named “El Guerito” and its mother “Alma” at a sanctuary. They had both been rescued from a dairy farm of which the owner was closing down. When we met him, we looked into his warm eyes and soon visiting him became a weekly thing. Compassion with us started with just on meaningful connection. It made us who we are today. We genuinely hope you enjoy your meal and visit to our 100% compassionate and vegan restaurant!</p>
